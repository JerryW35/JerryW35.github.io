Hi!

I am Zirui Wang, currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Boston University. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Technology at Hangzhou Dianzi University.

My research interests involve a variety of areas such as data storage, stream processing systems, and parallel machine learning training. In addition, I am particularly interested in the area of machine learning systems.

Currently, I'm doing summer research with [Prof.Yue Cheng](https://tddg.github.io/)
