Hi!

I am Zirui Wang, currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Boston University. I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Technology at Hangzhou Dianzi University.

In the ever-evolving field of computer science, my research interests span across a broad spectrum including data storage, stream processing systems, and parallel machine learning training. I am particularly enthralled by the opportunities to delve deeper and contribute meaningful insights in these areas.

Currently, I'm doing summer research with [Prof.Yue Cheng](https://tddg.github.io/)
